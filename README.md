# üß™ Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) Image Simulation  

This repository contains a **Python simulation of Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM)**.  
The goal is to demonstrate the key concepts of SIM ‚Äî how structured patterns shift high-frequency information into the passband, and how computational reconstruction recovers resolution beyond the diffraction limit.  

The simulation includes:  
- Generation of a synthetic ground truth object  
- Widefield (low-pass filtered) imaging  
- Structured illumination (multiple orientations & phases)  
- Fourier domain analysis (central + sidebands)  
- Reconstruction with subpixel Fourier shifting  
- Noise modeling (Gaussian & Poisson)  
- Wiener-like weighting for noise suppression  
- Final comparison of clean vs noisy reconstructions  
- Figures with automatic **scale bars**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
- Run the simulation:
- python main.py
- This will:

Generate a synthetic test object.

Perform SIM image simulation and reconstruction.

Display Fourier spectra, frequency components, and reconstructed images.

Show both clean and noisy reconstructions with scale bars.
